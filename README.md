# Fae-Conquers-Code
My journey through Web development – learning, growing and coding.

# Fae's Web Dev Journey

This repository will track my progress as I learn web development and database management. I’m starting from scratch—learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL—and I’ll be documenting every step of the way.

The world will watch me rise. #WatchMeGrow
